# Budget_Expense_Tracker
A budgeting and expense tracking program that tracks a user's expenses and budgets on a month to month basis. 
Allows user to manually input or import spending data which is then displayed with a budget. The user can then edit the budget and see how their spending changes over time. 
Current stage of development: Created the ADT models for tracking the users expenses, income, and budget for each month. Working on creating the interface for the user to interact with and storing user data.
